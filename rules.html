<h1 id="dungeon-world-d-d-cross-over">Dungeon world &amp; D&amp;D Cross Over</h1>
<p>The rules presented below are mostly for <em>behind the screen</em> mechanics. It simply gives structure specific type of play style. On the players end, the game is the same, fighters still announce that they &#39;swing their sword&#39; and the monk still announces &#39;I grab the arrow out of the air&#39;. You <em>should not</em> announce a move name, you should first describe what your character or monster is doing, and then follow through with the mechanics.</p>
<p>However, these rules put a <strong>greater</strong> emphasis on DM &amp; Player description, or ensuring your game is &#39;fiction first&#39;. In addition to more fiction, these rules also implement <strong>partial successes</strong> for <strong>attack rolles</strong> and <strong>ability</strong> and <strong>skill checks</strong>. Lastly, they <strong>remove initiative</strong> and <strong>actions</strong> in favor of a more &#39;fiction first&#39; fighting style, and require the DM to make &#39;hard&#39; or &#39;soft&#39; moves.</p>

<h2 id="general-rules">General Rules</h2>
<h3 id="ammo">Ammo</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ammo is represented as a &#39;count&#39;.</li>
<li>This does not represent the exact amount of arrows, bolts, etc.</li>
<li>Instead this represents that the ammo is available to you<ul>
<li>Ammo can be spent by soft / hard moves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="distance">Distance</h3>
<p>Different tags to represent how far away something is. These are mechanics that should be attached to weapons and other mechanical items. They should not be used as part of your descriptions.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hand</em>: It’s useful for attacking something within your reach, no further.</li>
<li><em>Close</em>: It’s useful for attacking something at arm’s reach plus a foot or two.</li>
<li><em>Reach</em>: It’s useful for attacking something that’s several feet away—maybe as far as ten.</li>
<li><em>Near</em>: It’s useful for attacking if you can see the whites of their eyes.</li>
<li><em>Far</em>: It’s useful for attacking something in shouting distance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="moves">Moves</h2>
<p>Moves are simply something that the characters can do, in or outside of combat. They are to be used as replacements for attacking with melee or ranged weapons. These moves closely mirror the moves from dungeon world, but are modified for D&amp;D.</p>
<p>An important difference to note between Dungeon World and D&amp;D is that instead of announcing your move as &#39;I mark him as my quarry&#39;, you should &#39;lead with the fiction&#39; or make sure your &#39;fiction&#39; is first. This means that you would refrase the previous statement as &#39;I yell and point at the bandit calling out his position, and marking him as my quarry&#39;. This paints a picture of <em>how</em> your character uses their skills followed by the mechanical implication of your skill.</p>
<p>Moves give the GM an opportunity to move the story forward. When the player performs a move the response should either be a hard or soft move.</p>
<p>For partial successes, you should stick with soft moves generally. Partial successes will happen more often than not, and they provide a perfect way to drive the story forward with a call to action. This call to action could be &quot;The king doesn&#39;t believe your lie and see&#39;s straight through it. What do you do?&quot; or &quot;The dragon egg tumbles from your hands, rocketing towards the chasm. What do you do?&quot;.</p>
<p>For failures, respond with a hard move, and then provide an avenue for another player to respond. Such as, &quot;The blink bites down hard on Sylvans arm, causing 6 damage, and making him drop his bow. With a dog attached to Sylvans arm and Gork surrounded, Ernard, what do you do&quot;</p>
<p>Although, these are all suggestions. If want something to be really hard, make more hard moves. Want something to be easy? make more soft moves.</p>

<h5 id="setting-a-dc">Setting a DC</h5>
<p>This is a GM facing rule, the players will only ever see this rule in action as they contest a DC. The Following rule gives a loose structure of how the DM should set difficulty of a task. If more fine tuning is needed, feel free to add a couple of points to the DC. Need a task that falls between easy and moderate? Set the DC at 13, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trivial</strong> <em>(DC 5, Partial Success 4 - 3, Failure 2)</em>:<ul>
<li>a task that is so easy that isn&#39;t worth a check. An adventurer can almost always succeed automatically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Easy</strong> <em>(DC 10, Partial Success 9 - 5, Failure 4)</em>:<ul>
<li>requires a minimum level of competence or a bit of luck to accomplish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Moderate</strong> <em>(DC 15, Partial Success 14 - 7, Failure 6)</em>:<ul>
<li>requires a bit more competence to accomplish. Can be completed more often than not by a character with both natural aptitude and specialized training.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hard</strong> <em>(DC 20, Partial Success 19 - 10, Failure 9)</em>:<ul>
<li>include anything beyond the capabilities of the average person without aid or exceptional talent. Even with a bit of training and skill you still need some luck to pull it off (or maybe some specialized training).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Very Hard</strong> <em>(DC 25, Partial Success 24 - 13, Failure 12)</em>:<ul>
<li>achievable only by especially talented individuals. Nobody else should even bother trying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Formidable</strong> <em>(DC 30, Partial Success 29 - 15, Failure 14)</em>:<ul>
<li>achievable only by the most trained, experienced, and talented individuals, and they probably still need help to pull it off.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nearly Impossible</strong> <em>(DC 35, Partial Success 34 - 18, Failure 17)</em>:<ul>
<li>can&#39;t be done without assistance unless you&#39;re basically a demigod.</li>
