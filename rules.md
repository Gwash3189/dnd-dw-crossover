# Dungeon world & D&D Cross Over

The rules presented below are mostly for *behind the screen* mechanics. It simply gives structure specific type of play style. On the players end, the game is the same, fighters still announce that they 'swing their sword' and the monk still announces 'I grab the arrow out of the air'. You *should not* announce a move name, you should first describe what your character or monster is doing, and then follow through with the mechanics.

However, these rules put a **greater** emphasis on DM & Player description, or ensuring your game is 'fiction first'. In addition to more fiction, these rules also implement **partial successes** for **attack rolles** and **ability** and **skill checks**. Lastly, they **remove initiative** and **actions** in favor of a more 'fiction first' fighting style, and require the DM to make 'hard' or 'soft' moves.

For more information on hard or soft moves, or how to run combat in this way, checkout [Dungeon World](www.dungeon-world.com).

## General Rules

### Ammo
* Ammo is represented as a 'count'.
* This does not represent the exact amount of arrows, bolts, etc.
* Instead this represents that the ammo is available to you
 * Ammo can be spent by soft / hard moves

### Distance

Different tags to represent how far away something is. These are mechanics that should be attached to weapons and other mechanical items. They should not be used as part of your descriptions. 

* *Hand*: It’s useful for attacking something within your reach, no further.
* *Close*: It’s useful for attacking something at arm’s reach plus a foot or two.
* *Reach*: It’s useful for attacking something that’s several feet away—maybe as far as ten.
* *Near*: It’s useful for attacking if you can see the whites of their eyes.
* *Far*: It’s useful for attacking something in shouting distance.


## Moves

Moves are simply something that the characters can do, in or outside of combat. They are to be used as replacements for attacking with melee or ranged weapons. These moves closely mirror the moves from dungeon world, but are modified for D&D.

An important difference to note between Dungeon World and D&D is that instead of announcing your move as 'I mark him as my quarry', you should 'lead with the fiction' or make sure your 'fiction' is first. This means that you would refrase the previous statement as 'I yell and point at the bandit calling out his position, and marking him as my quarry'. This paints a picture of *how* your character uses their skills followed by the mechanical implication of your skill.

Moves give the GM an opportunity to move the story forward. When the player performs a move the response should either be a hard or soft move.

For partial successes, you should stick with soft moves generally. Partial successes will happen more often than not, and they provide a perfect way to drive the story forward with a call to action. This call to action could be "The king doesn't believe your lie and see's straight through it. What do you do?" or "The dragon egg tumbles from your hands, rocketing towards the chasm. What do you do?".

For failures, respond with a hard move, and then provide an avenue for another player to respond. Such as, "The blink bites down hard on Sylvans arm, causing 6 damage, and making him drop his bow. With a dog attached to Sylvans arm and Gork surrounded, Ernard, what do you do"

Although, these are all suggestions. If want something to be really hard, make more hard moves. Want something to be easy? make more soft moves.

### Combat

#### Actions

* *Actions* are removed, characters aren't bound by actions in responding to soft or hard moves.

#### Attack Roles

Attack roles are rolled exactly the same. Rules for success, partial success and failure are as follows.

 * **Success**
  * `AC <= Attack Roll`
 * **Partial success**
  * `Attack Roll > AC / 2 OR Attack Roll < AC - 1`
 * **Failure**
  * `Attack Roll < AC / 2`

#### Initiative
* No Monsters turns & instead attack as part of GM soft & hard moves.
* Remove initiative & replace with Dungeon world style fighting
  * Characters are prompted with soft moves
    * *the minotaur charges, horns down, what do you do?*
    * *You're pinned behind the wall by the relentless shower of arrows, what do you do?*
    * *Joseph is attempting to resist your possession, you can feel your grip on his mind slipping. What do you do?*
  * Enemies respond with soft or hard moves
    * Hard - move the story forward by forcing the character to action
      * *You fumble over your feet trying to avoid the minotaur and he tackles you with his horns, roll 1d8.*
      * *You peek from behind the cover to see if there are any vantage points. While you do this an arrow scrapes against your head, roll 1d6.*
      * *You crumple when presented with Josephs superior skills, you are flung to the back of his mind, rendering you helpless.*
    * Soft - Drive the story forward and let the characters respond
      *  *You stumble but jump out of the way in time, being narrowly missed by the minitor. You don't have any time to rest, he's now grabbing near by rubble and hurling it at you. What do you do?*
      * *You lean around the corner to see if there is a better vantage point. Under your weight, the crumbling bit of stone you were hiding behind falls to bits letting arrows through, what do you do?*
      * *Joseph bombards you with mental attacks and nearly overwhelms you, he is trying probing the deep secrets of your mind, what do you do? *

#### Hack & Slash

A port of the *Hack and Slash* move from dungeon world. Used for when a player is swinging their sword, or a branch they found on the ground. Anything melee related. Follow normal D&D rules for rolling an attack role, then apply the following rules for success, partial success and failure.

 * **Success**
  * At your option, you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s attack.
 * **Partial success**
  * you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you
 * **Failure**
  * You'll receive a hard move from the DM.

#### Volly

Used when firing a projectile of any kind, with the exclusion of magic. This can be a bolt, arrow, or rock. Really, it's any ranged attack that's not magic. Follow normal D&D rules for rolling an attack role, then apply the following rules for success, partial success and failure.

* **Success**
  * You do your damage, woo!.
* **Partial success - Choose One**
  * You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger of the GM’s choice
  * You have to take what you can get: -1 Damage Dice damage
  * You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one.
* **Failure**
  * You'll receive a hard move from the DM.


#### Magic
 * Remove distance requirements from spells, excluding **Touch** spells.
 * **Touch** spells must cast on someone who is within *Hands* distance
 * If you wish to cast a touch spell on someone out of range, have the player defy danger.

### Other Moves
#### Defy Danger

The requirements of success, partial success and failure are as follows

 * **Success**
  * `DC <= Check Roll`
 * **Partial Success**
  * `Check Roll > DC / 2 OR Check Roll < DC - 1`
 * **Failure**
  * `Check Roll < DC / 2`

Defy Danger represent a skills check by the character. The player should describe how their character is **acting despite an imminent threat** or they are **preventing a calamity**. Depending on that description, use the appropriate **skill**

* **Success**
  *  You do what you set out to, yay!.
* **Partial Success**
  * You stumble, hesitate or flinch, the GM will offer you a soft or hard move.
* **Failure**
  *  The GM will offer you a hard move, you do not do what you set out to do, boo!

###### Setting a DC

This is a GM facing rule, the players will only ever see this rule in action as they contest a DC. The Following rule gives a loose structure of how the DM should set difficulty of a task. If more fine tuning is needed, feel free to add a couple of points to the DC. Need a task that falls between easy and moderate? Set the DC at 13, etc.

 * **Trivial** *(DC 5, Partial Success 4 - 3, Failure 2)*:
  * a task that is so easy that isn't worth a check. An adventurer can almost always succeed automatically.
 * **Easy** *(DC 10, Partial Success 9 - 5, Failure 4)*:
  * requires a minimum level of competence or a bit of luck to accomplish.
 * **Moderate** *(DC 15, Partial Success 14 - 7, Failure 6)*:
  * requires a bit more competence to accomplish. Can be completed more often than not by a character with both natural aptitude and specialized training.
 * **Hard** *(DC 20, Partial Success 19 - 10, Failure 9)*:
  * include anything beyond the capabilities of the average person without aid or exceptional talent. Even with a bit of training and skill you still need some luck to pull it off (or maybe some specialized training).
 * **Very Hard** *(DC 25, Partial Success 24 - 13, Failure 12)*:
  * achievable only by especially talented individuals. Nobody else should even bother trying.
 * **Formidable** *(DC 30, Partial Success 29 - 15, Failure 14)*:
  * achievable only by the most trained, experienced, and talented individuals, and they probably still need help to pull it off.
 * **Nearly Impossible** *(DC 35, Partial Success 34 - 18, Failure 17)*:
  * can't be done without assistance unless you're basically a demigod.

## **Example play**

* **GM**: Gork, the Orc chieftain see's through your illusion. He shouts *I've had enough of this, You're not my real wife!*, what do you do?
* **Gork**: Ha, i'll show him! I dive at him with *justice* high above my head.
* **GM**: Ha! Well, he's swinging his mace widely in his anger, destroying his tent, you'll have to get past that first before you can strike him.
* **Gork**: Fuck em'. I stop his mace with *justice* and slide it along the hilt of his mace, aiming for his arm.
* **GM**: Roll an athletics check to withstand his onslaught
* **Gork**:  uh... 4 (failure)
* **GM**: Unforuntatly the Chieftain overpowers you sends you flying to the other side of the tent with a mace to the chest. He follows you as you overturn a table and break a chair, causing 8 damage.
* **Gork**: Fine. If i can't take him out, i'll take his ankles out! I cast *fireball* at his ankles from down here.  
* **GM**: Jesus fucking christ, alright, Roll attack
* **Gork**: ... 16 (success)
* **GM**: Nice!, The Chieftain's boots are smouldering away, roll damage.
* **Gork**:  uh... 6
* **GM**:Alright, the Chieftain's legs are nearly on fire and at this moment, the Chieftains back is turned to the rest of the tent as he closes on Gork, Sylvan, what do you do?
* **Sylvan**: I shout 'You look like shit!' and mark him as my quarry and shoot an arrow straight at his leg.
* **GM**: Roll an attack roll
