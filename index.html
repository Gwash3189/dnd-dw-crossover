        <ul>
            <li>Ammo

                <ul>
                    <li>Ammo is represented as a 'count'.</li>
                    <li>This does not represent the exact amount of arrows etc.</li>
                    <li>Instead this represents that the ammo is available to you

                        <ul>
                            <li>Ammo can be spent by soft / hard moves</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Distance

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>Hand</em>: It’s useful for attacking something within your reach, no further.</li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Close</em>: It’s useful for attacking something at arm’s reach plus a foot or two.</li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Reach</em>: It’s useful for attacking something that’s several feet away—maybe as far as ten.</li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Near</em>: It’s useful for attacking if you can see the whites of their eyes.</li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Far</em>: It’s useful for attacking something in shouting distance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>
<a id="moves" class="anchor" href="#moves" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Moves</h4>

        <p>Moves are simply something that the characters can do, in or outside of combat. They are to be used as replacements for attacking with melee or ranged weapons. These moves closely mirror the moves from dungeon world, but are modified for D&amp;D.</p>

        <p>An important difference to note between Dungeon World and D&amp;D is that instead of announcing your move as 'I mark him as my quarry', you should 'lead with the fiction' or make sure your 'fiction' is first. This means that you would refrase the previous statement as 'I yell and point at the bandit calling out his position, and marking him as my quarry'. This paints a picture of <em>how</em> your character uses their skills followed by the mechanical implication of your skill.</p>

        <p>This is a GM facing rule, the players will only ever see this rule in action as they contest a DC. The Following rule gives a loose structure of how the DM should set difficulty of a task. If more fine tuning is needed, feel free to add a couple of points to the DC. Need a task that falls between easy and moderate? Set the DC at 13, etc.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Trivial</strong> <em>(DC 5, Partial Success 3, Failure 2)</em>:

                <ul>
                    <li>a task that is so easy that isn't worth a check. An adventurer can almost always succeed automatically.</li>

            <li>

            <li>
